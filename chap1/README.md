BANK.PY

This script demonstrates multithreading for deposit and withdrawal operations on a shared balance, with synchronization using locks and execution time measurement.

DATA_PARALLELISM.PY

This script demonstrates concurrent execution of tasks using Python's `ThreadPoolExecutor`, with two tasks running in parallel.


DO_SOMETHING.PY

This script defines a function to generate a specified number of random floating-point numbers and append them to a list.


FIBONACCI.PY

This script demonstrates multithreading in Python by calculating the Fibonacci sequence for a given number using multiple threads and measuring execution time.



HELLO.PY

This script demonstrates data parallel computation by performing vector addition using NumPy and measuring execution time.


IPC.PY
This script demonstrates a producer-consumer model using Python's multiprocessing module and a shared queue for inter-process communication.


MPI.PY

This script showcases MPI communication where process 0 sends a dictionary to process 1, while other processes remain idle.


MULTIPROCESSING.PY

This script compares the performance of multiprocessing and multithreading in Python for processing large lists, using the `do_something` function.


PARALLELIZATION.PY

This script demonstrates parallel computation for vector addition using Python's `ThreadPoolExecutor`, dividing the workload across multiple threads.

PROCESS_CREATION.PY

This script demonstrates the use of multiprocessing to calculate and print the square and cube of a number in separate processes.


SHARED_MEM.PY

This script demonstrates thread synchronization using locks to safely simulate bank deposit and withdrawal operations in multithreading.


SYNCHRONIZATION.PY

This script demonstrates thread synchronization using a semaphore to manage access to a shared resource among multiple threads.
